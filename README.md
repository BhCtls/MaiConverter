# MaiConverter
Converts standard 3simai files to sdt files so you can play custom charts in your favorite touchlaundry machine. Python done quick and dirty.

If you're not familiar with these file formats, then you can read about sdt files [here](https://listed.to/@donmai/18173/the-four-chart-formats-of-maimai-classic) and simai files [here](https://w.atwiki.jp/simai/pages/25.html). You can read about my blog post about this [here](https://listed.to/@donmai/18284/newly-released-simai-to-sdt-converter)

# Usage
Just point the program to your `maidata.txt` and it will convert it to an sdt file.
